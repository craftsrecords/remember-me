The purpose of this project is to show how a simple Java application can be easily migrated from JUnit 4 to [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5). You'll find each test implemented in both versions of the framework.
It's also meant to demonstrate some of the cool new JUnit 5 features, like parameter injection or test interfaces.

If you want to know more about JUnit 5 novelties, please refer to the [user guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide).
